# Phish Telegram Bot

Commands:
Simply type `/` into Telegram when you are chatting with the bot or read `main()` of   `app.py`

Notes:
Environmental variables are stored as [heroku config vars](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars)

Development:
* You need [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) installed.
* Run `source start-dev-env.sh` to start virtual environment, log in to heroku and store local env variables. Include a Phishy surprise with `-p` or `--phish`.

The environmental variables stored are:
1. BOT_TOKEN=`bot_token` (token for `@gone_phishing_bot` from BotFather)
2. BOT_USERNAME=`username` (username for `@gone_phishing_bot` from BotFather)
3. URL=`url` (url of heroku app)
4. PHISHNET_API_KEY=`api_key` (API Key for Phish.Net, [retrieved here](https://api.phish.net/request-key))
5. PHISHIN_API_KEY=`api_key` (API Key for Phish.in can be requested at the [contacts page](https://phish.in/contact-info) and info about the api can be found in the [api docs](https://phish.in/api-docs))

Ideas:
1. Phish Trivia Game!
2. Next Phish Show (location/date)
3. Phish Radio (message bot the song you want to hear and adds a random jam of that song to the queue)
   1. In-time pings of messages received?
